Unhangman
===============

A game I developed as a project for my web immersive course at bootcamp, *Unhangman* is a twist on the original Hangman. (I dare say, that to myself it was the original because that was how I had played it my whole life! I think ðŸ¤”). I had so much fun creating this that there maaay just be plans in the works to expand it in the future. *Gasp, how could this possibly get more entertaining*, you ask? Just wait and see!

The Twist
---------

Instead of adding body parts every time the player guesses incorrectly, you are already hanging and body parts are dismembered! Try to save the man before it's too late. Woah. Additionally there is an *original game* feature for those that are a little squeamish. Enjoy!
